Dutch art in a global age

Summary:
The seventeenth century has long been considered a "golden age" for Dutch art, fueled by the Dutch Republic's growth as an economic world power. Nourished by an innovative stock market and burgeoning global trade network, this vibrant economy not only provided artists with a rich context in which to make their art, but also directly influenced the art itself--in its subject matter, materials, meaning, and interpretation. The genre scenes and still lifes that today seem quintessentially Dutch actually project a global vision, and often address the positive and the negative of economic and global expansion. Drawing on the world-renowned collection of Dutch paintings, works on paper, decorative arts, and illustrated books at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, this book offers a fresh look at seventeenth-century Dutch art, accompanied by authoritative essays that ask readers to consider the global context in which this work was made.

Title:
The kings of the Slavs : the image of a ruler in the Latin text of the Chronicle of the priest of Duklja

Authors:
Wawrzyniec Kowalski

Summary:
The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja is considered to be among the most important and mysterious narrative sources discussing the Slavic presence on the Adriatic coast and its hinterland. It is also one of the most controversial. This detailed study examines the Latin version of the chronicle, and it explores the deeper meanings hidden behind the history of the contrived monarchy, acknowledging the tradition regarding the fate of its leading rulers. The work focuses on four representatives of the royal family, rulers during key periods in the narrative. Each of the kings presented a different pattern of rule, and each of them, in his own way, established new rules for the functioning of the Kingdom of the Slavs

Title:
Indigenous sacraments : Christian rituals and local responses at the fringes of Spanish America, 1529-1800

Authors:
Oriol Ambrogio Gali

Summary:
Indigenous Sacraments provides the first study of Indigenous perceptions of the Christian sacraments at the fringes of colonial Spanish America, particularly in the missions established by the Jesuits in northwestern Mexico, central southern Chile, and the Gran Chaco. After Jesuit missionaries arrived in these regions between the end of the sixteenth and the early seventeenth centuries, their sacraments came to control every rite of passage, from birth to reaching adulthood to the formation of new families to death. Through the administration of the sacraments, missionaries intended to replace extant Indigenous habits and beliefs with Christian values. The disruptions triggered by such processes raised multiple local reactions, from initial curiosity and incomprehension to rejection, partial acceptance, and ritual imitation. Locals debated the newly introduced rituals and both violently rejected them and developed their own versions, becoming active participants in the sacraments' diffusion. Oriol Ambrogio Gali draws on a range of diverse sources to explore the changing attitudes toward the sacraments and to highlight the cultural and religious evolution of the Indigenous groups living at the fringes of Spanish America. By exploring local perceptions of the Christian sacraments, Ambrogio Gali shows that Indigenous peoples were far from static recipients of Christianity in the Americas.

Title:
On the Edge of the Cosmos : a Century of Revolution in Astronomy

Authors:
Alain Omont (Author)

Summary:
In a world where intergalactic wars are a common topic for movies, it is hard to imagine that the discovery of galaxies was made less than a century ago. In fact, it was one of the key astrophysical milestones of the first half of the 20th century, along with the revelation of the expansion of the Universe and the understanding of the source of the stars' energy. The second half of last century saw the unexpected discovery of fantastic objects and extreme events in the Universe including neutron stars, black holes, radio galaxies, quasars, exoplanets, or stellar explosions. Modern cosmology was simultaneously established with the Big Bang model, leading to an astonishingly precise determination of the parameters of the Universe. The author here retraces the adventure of twentieth-century astronomy and describes how it has changed our vision of the cosmos. By assessing the major successes of this undertaking and highlighting the fundamental questions that still remain, he puts into perspective the recent progress at the dawn of the new millennium including the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe and dark energy, dark matter, exoplanets, black hole mergers and gravitational waves, to name only the most spectacular discoveries. This book thus offers, in a concise and accessible form, a synthesis of our current knowledge of astrophysics, including many beautiful images from leading observatories

Rashid Johnson : a poem for deep thinkers

Rashid Johnson (Artist, Interviewee), Naomi Beckwith (Editor, Writer of supplementary textual content), Andrea Karnes (Editor, Writer of supplementary textual content), Julian Myers (Writer of supplementary textual content), Nana Adusei-Poku (Writer of supplementary textual content), Hendrik Folkerts (Writer of supplementary textual content), Tiona Nekkia McClodden (Writer of supplementary textual content), Odili Donald Odita (Interviewer), Kevin Everod Quashie (Writer of supplementary textual content), Amiri Baraka, Gwendolyn Brooks, Paul Beatty, Jean Genet, Toni Morrison, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (Host institution), Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (Host institution), Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago, Ill) (Host institution)

Summary:
From his early self-portraits to his site-specific installations, this volume underscores Rashid Johnson's fearless engagement with the central themes, questions, and aesthetics of the contemporary era. Co-organized by the Guggenheim New York and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, A Poem for Deep Thinkers is a three-decade survey of Rashid Johnson's artistic career. It situates the artist within three interconnected spheres: as a scholar of art history; as a mediator of Black popular culture and its widespread commodification; and as an artist engaged with the globalization of contemporary art. The exhibition and accompanying catalogue feature nearly 90 artworks, including early photographs, Cosmic Slops, spray-painted text works, collage paintings, Broken Men mosaics, film projects, and key sculptures and installations that incorporate materials such as shea butter, black soap, plants, ceramic vessels, and wax. These explorations demonstrate Johnson's uncommon fluency with multiple materials and forms as well as a nuanced ability to synthesize the condition of the human psyche.
