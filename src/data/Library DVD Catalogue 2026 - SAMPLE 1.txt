Credits:

Plot:
One of Shakespeare's best-loved comedies, Twelfth Night was 'blissfully reborn' for the 2012/13 season at London's Globe Theatre, under the direction of Tim Carroll. The hilarious tale of misdirection and deception is performed here by an all-male cast, as it would have been in Shakespeare's day, with Mark Rylance playing Olivia and Roger Lloyd Pack as the hapless Sir Andrew Aguecheek. The production also marks Stephen Fry's triumphant return to the stage as the pompous Malvolio, ridiculous in his yellow stockings.

Credits:
Director, producer, editor, cinematographer and original music, Gary Tarn ; executive producers, Alfonso Cuaro´n, Andrew Ruhemann, Frida Torresblanco ; executive producer for BBC, Nick Fraser ; co-producer, John Battsek ; story, by Hugues de Montalembert.

Plot:
Painter Hugues de Montalembert was blinded in an attack in New York City in 1978. Without self-pity, he relates his extraordinary story of how he adapted his approach to the world after blindness, and continued living and travelling unaided through the world. As he says, 'vision is a creation ... some people use their eyes to avoid obstacles, not to look at the world or to understand something. In fact they are not really interested in looking at all'. Composer and filmmaker Gary Tarn has created a film that approximates to what it is like to see through Montalembert's eyes. If you want an affirmative, uplifting and courageous tale that is neither sanctimonious nor saccharine, and leaves you considering your own attitude to life, and how little you really make use of all the senses you have, then this is it.

Plot:
The West has positioned itself as the protagonist of development, giving rise to a vast multi-billion dollar poverty industry. The business of doing good has never been better, yet the results have been mixed, in some cases even catastrophic. Leaders in the developing world are growing increasingly vocal in calling for change. Drawing from over 200 interviews filmed in 20 countries, Poverty, Inc. unearths an uncomfortable side of charity we can no longer ignore. From TOMs Shoes to international adoptions, from solar panels to U.S. agricultural subsidies, the film challenges each of us to ask the tough question: Could I be part of the problem?"--Container
